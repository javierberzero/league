        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Lux </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with fear and suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her power secret in order to preserve her family’s noble status. Nonetheless, Lux’s optimism and resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now seeks to bring greater tolerance and understanding to her homeland.</p>

        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Morgana </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">Conflicted between her celestial and mortal natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the corrupt. She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia—even as others seek to repress it—by casting shields and chains of dark fire. More than anything else, Morgana truly believes that even the banished and outcast may one day rise again.</p>

    <div class="champions__container champions__container--reverse" id="vi">
        <img class="champions__img" src="../img/Vi_0.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Vi </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">Once a criminal from the mean streets of Zaun, Vi is a hotheaded, impulsive, and fearsome woman with only a very loose respect for authority figures. Growing up all but alone, Vi developed finely honed survival instincts as well as a wickedly abrasive sense of humor. Now working with the Wardens to keep the peace in Piltover, she wields mighty hextech gauntlets that can punch through walls—and suspects—with equal ease.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="champions__container" id="jhin">
        <img class="champions__img" src="../img/Jhin_0.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Jhin </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia’s ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.</p>

    <div class="champions__container champions__container--reverse" id="miss">

        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Miss Fortune </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">ABilgewater captain famed for her looks but feared for her ruthlessness, Sarah Fortune paints a stark figure among the hardened criminals of the port city. As a child, she witnessed the reaver king Gangplank murder her family—an act she brutally avenged years later, blowing up his flagship while he was still aboard. Those who underestimate her will face a beguiling and unpredictable opponent… and, likely, a bullet or two in their guts.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="champions__container" id="ezreal">
        <img class="champions__img" src="../img/Ezreal.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="champions__h3-p">
            <h3 class="champions__h3">Ezreal </h3>
            <p class="champions__p">Adashing adventurer, unknowingly gifted in the magical arts, Ezreal raids long-lost catacombs, tangles with ancient curses, and overcomes seemingly impossible odds with ease. His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts. One thing is for sure—whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn’t too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.</p>

    <div class="champions__container champions__container--reverse" id="jinx">
    <img class="champions__img" src="../img/Jinx.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="champions__h3-p">
        <h3 class="champions__h3">Jinx </h3>
        <p class="champions__p">Amanic and impulsive criminal from Zaun, Jinx lives to wreak havoc without care for the consequences. With an arsenal of deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest explosions to leave a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. Jinx despises boredom, and gleefully brings her own chaotic brand of pandemonium wherever she goes.</p>

<div class="champions__container" id="ekko">
<img class="champions__img" src="../img/Ekko.jpg" alt="">
<div class="champions__h3-p">
    <h3 class="champions__h3">Ekko </h3>
    <p class="champions__p">
        Aprodigy from the rough streets of Zaun, Ekko manipulates time to twist any situation to his advantage. Using his own invention, the Z-Drive, he explores the branching possibilities of reality to craft the perfect moment. Though he revels in this freedom, when there’s a threat to his friends, he’ll do anything to defend them. To outsiders, Ekko seems to achieve the impossible the first time, every time.</p>

<div class="champions__container champions__container--reverse" id="lee">
<img class="champions__img" src="../img/Lee_Sin.jpg" alt="">
<div class="champions__h3-p">
    <h3 class="champions__h3">Lee Sin </h3>
    <p class="champions__p">Amaster of Ionia’s ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance. Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks.</p>

<div class="champions__container" id="caitlyn">
<img class="champions__img" src="../img/Caitlyn.jpg" alt="">
<div class="champions__h3-p">
    <h3 class="champions__h3">Caitlyn </h3>
    <p class="champions__p">Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn is also Piltover’s best shot at ridding the city of its elusive criminal elements. She is often paired with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.</p>
